# Architecture

This page is the technical map of AgentGem: how a request flows from a client, through
the contract surface, into the framework-agnostic Gem core, and out to archives, targets,
the registry, and deploy backends. For the conceptual "why," read [Concepts](concepts.md)
first.

## The big picture

There are four horizontal bands:

1. **Hosts / clients** — the web UI (`src/public/index.html`), any local coding agent, and
   the [Desktop app](desktop.md), which embeds the same server in Electron (tray + auto-update).
2. **Contract surface** — one Zod definition per operation, surfaced as a REST endpoint, an
   MCP tool, and an OpenAPI 3.1 document. See [the one-contract model](#the-one-contract-model).
3. **Gem core** (`src/gem/`) — pure, framework-agnostic functions: `introspect` → `redact`
   → `buildGem` → `archive`. See the [build pipeline](pipeline.md).
4. **Distribution** — the neutral Gem feeds targets (materialize), the registry, deploy
   backends, and local testbeds/runs. See [distribution](#distribution) below.

An optional **workflow-aware recommendation** path sits in front of the core: `POST
/workflow/analyze` (plus an SSE progress stream) scans a project's Claude transcripts into a
deterministic `WorkflowSignal`, then runs two local ACP agents **concurrently** — one clusters
and names candidate Gems (degrading to a frequency ranking if the agent is unavailable), the
other **distills new draft skills** from the recurring builtin procedure the scan would otherwise
discard. It emits a `WorkflowAnalysis` of pre-checked `GemCandidate[]` plus `DistilledSkill[]`
drafts; both feed `buildGem` (an accepted draft is staged into the inventory by name). The
recommender only ranks what introspection already found; distillation is the deliberate exception
— brand-new drafts behind a human-review gate. See [Analyze](analyze.md).

Server-side state lives under `~/.agentgem` (workspaces, recents, credentials, deploy
records) — never inside a Gem.

## The one-contract model

AgentGem is built on **AgentBack**. The entry point `src/index.ts` wires a single
`RestApplication` with both an HTTP server and an MCP server:

```ts
const app = new RestApplication({});
app.configure("servers.RestServer").to({ port, host: "127.0.0.1" });
app.component(MCPComponent);
app.configure("servers.MCPServer").to({ name: "agentgem", version: "0.1.0", transports: { stdio: false } });
app.restController(GemController);   // REST  → /api/*
app.service(GemTools);              // MCP   → /mcp
await installExplorer(app, { title: "agentgem API" }); // OpenAPI + Swagger → /explorer
await installMcpHttp(app);
```

| Boundary | Surfaced by | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | `GemController` (`@api`) | `/api/*` | 35+ endpoints; the stateful surface (workspaces, deploy, publish) |
| MCP | `GemTools` (`@mcpServer`) | `/mcp` | 6 tools; read + plan operations for agents |
| OpenAPI / Swagger | `installExplorer` | `/explorer` | Derived from the same Zod schemas |
| Web UI | Express route | `/` | Serves the single-page builder |

REST and MCP are **not** parallel re-implementations: both call the same helper functions
(e.g. `introspectAll`, `buildGem`) and validate against the same schemas in
`src/schemas.ts`. The REST surface simply adds the stateful operations (workspace CRUD,
run, deploy, publish) that a UI needs; MCP focuses on the read-and-plan operations an agent
needs. See the full list in the [API reference](api-reference.md).

Because every operation is decorator-defined, the build **must** compile with
`experimentalDecorators` + `emitDecoratorMetadata` — see [Development](development.md).

## The Gem core

Everything under `src/gem/` is framework-agnostic — no HTTP, no decorators, just functions
over plain data. That is what lets the same code back a web request, an MCP tool call, and
a test. The pipeline is documented in detail in [The build pipeline](pipeline.md); the
on-disk result is specified in [Archive format](archive-format.md); the safety rule that
governs all of it is in [Redaction](redaction.md).

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `introspect.ts` | Read `~/.claude`, plugins, `~/.agents`, `~/.codex`, `~/.hermes`, and project dirs into a `ConfigInventory` |
| `redact.ts` | Strip secret values at capture; record `SecretRef[]` |
| `buildGem.ts` | Select artifacts by name → a `Gem` (+ checks, `requiredSecrets`) |
| `archive.ts` | Lay a Gem out as `gem.json` (manifest) + `gem.lock` and verify integrity |
| `archiveFs.ts` / `archiveTar.ts` | Serialize the file tree to a directory or a deterministic `.tar.gz` |
| `checks.ts` | Scaffold behavioral + external (`skillspector`) checks |
| `types.ts` | The core types: `Gem`, `GemArtifact`, `ConfigInventory`, `GemCheck`, … |

The optional **Analyze / workflow-aware** path (see [Analyze](analyze.md)) adds, also under
`src/gem/`:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `workflowScan.ts` | Scan transcripts → `WorkflowSignal`: artifact usage + co-occurrence, plus (opt-in) the redacted builtin **procedure**, **mission hints**, and frequent-n-gram **procedure recurrence** |
| `scrub.ts` | Field-aware, **default-deny** scrubbing of builtin tool inputs (free text) — distinct from `redact.ts`'s config-value redaction |
| `acpRecommender.ts` | Cluster usage into `GemCandidate[]`; validate against the inventory; degrade to a deterministic ranking |
| `distill.ts` | Phase-0 gate over recurring procedures → a generative ACP run → evidence-grounded `DistilledSkill[]` drafts |
| `draftStage.ts` | Stage a draft into the `ConfigInventory` (so `buildGem` can include it) and write `~/.agentgem/distilled/<name>/SKILL.md` |

## Distribution

The Gem is a neutral source. Three subsystems consume it, plus local testbeds and runs.

> [interactive HTML](diagrams/distribution.html)

- **Targets** (`targets.ts`) — `materialize(gem, target)` runs per-artifact renderers and a
  cross-cutting `compose` hook to emit a `FileTree`. Code-gen targets: Eve, Flue, OpenAI
  Sandbox, AgentCore, and A2A (an [Agent Card](a2a.md) projection with an opt-in runnable
  server) — plus the editor targets claude/codex/agents/hermes. See
  [Targets & deploy](targets.md).
- **Registry** (`registry.ts`, `registryGithub.ts`) — a GitHub-backed index plus per-version
  item archives; publish / resolve / merge / install with semver and a dependency graph. See
  [Registry](registry.md).
- **Deploy backends** (`deploy.ts`, `publish.ts`, `agentcorePublish.ts`) — Anthropic Managed
  Agents and AWS Bedrock AgentCore, each recorded in a deploy record that drives Undeploy.
- **Testbed & Run** (`testbed.ts`, `run.ts`) — install a Gem into a local `.claude`/`.codex`/
  `.hermes` testbed, or run/deploy a materialized project locally, to Vercel, or to
  Cloudflare. See [Testbed & run](testbed-and-run.md).
